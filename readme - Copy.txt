The Ultimate WooCommerce Extension to Grow Newsletter Signups from Your Online Store. Powered by ContactUs.com

== Description ==

This WooCommerce Extension, which is based off the popular [**Contact Form by ContactUs**](http://wordpress.org/plugins/contactuscom/) plugin, is used to generate Newsletter Signups and Sales Inquiries from visitors to your online store powered by [**WooCommerce**](http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/). Our forms are unobtrusive, and float on top of the underlying website, when they are triggered by the user. This way, you’re not taking attention away from ready-to-buy customers, but also giving options to contact or signup to your list if they are interested.

**This extension creates and places the following forms in the shop areas that you define:**

* **Newsletter Forms** – used to grow your email marketing list with existing shoppers or prospective shoppers who are interested but not yet ready to buy.  If you already have a newsletter, you know how effective it is already.  This extension helps you to grow your marketing list, and integrates with major email marketing providers that you probably already use.

* **Contact Forms** – used to generate sales leads and inquiries about your products (particularly on product sales that require some level of hand-holding). The higher the complexity of your product or service (and the higher the price), the more you’ll want to give your customers options to speak with someone.

**Advanced Marketing to Grow Your Customer Base (PREMIUM)**

* **In addition to the free features included in this plugin extension,** ContactUs.com also offers premium services that are used by online stores to grow their newsletter signups.

* **Top 100 online retailers and media websites use these techniques to grow their marketing lists.** They make sure that they get their signup forms in front of their users.  Either right after the form loads, after a few seconds, after the user clicks on a link or right before they are about to exit the page.

* As a premium user of the WooCommerce extension (for as low as $20 per month), you can use ContactUs.com’s advanced triggers to grow your email list signups the same way the big guys are doing it. It’s simple, and done in an all-in-one platform.
 
* **Free users already know the simplicity of ContactUs.com.**  Start with the simple online form-builder and then manage your software integrates (to sync with MailChimp, Constant Contact, Aweber or whichever email platform you use).  But for premium users (for as little as $20 per month), get access to some of our advanced form loading triggers built for online marketers.  Manage the rules to open up your signup form automatically.  Or delay the open by 5 seconds.  Or open it only when we detect the visitor about to bounce from your page. No coding required.

**We have worked hard in creating the most comprehensive, aggressive and Smart WooCommerce Newsletter extension plugin:** 

**Easy implementation**

You can choose form types, apply custom options and create a form experience for your website. But, if you are in a rush, you can set up the plugin in about 2 minutes with a standard form and callout tab combination, and it would start grabbing newsletter signups or generating sales leads, and in most cases, increasing your submission rate dramatically.   

**Great Documentation**

**Is this a generic Newsletter Plugin?**

Nope. This plugin is built to work with WooCommerce online stores. You need to have WooCommerce installed in your website in order to take full advantage of our WooCommerce Newsletter Signup plugin.
